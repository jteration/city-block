# City Block

A small animation done purely in HTML and CSS.

The entire thing can be scaled by the scale3d property on the .container section.

Many things could be refactored into variables which I may do in the future.

Uses 90% css-grid and 10% flexgrid.

The two things that can be tied to my home town of Kansas City is the Western Auto sign and the It's A Beautiful Day store.

The Western Auto building, located at 2107 Grand Blvd was built in 1914 for the Coca-Cola Company. It was later bought by the Western Auto Supply Company who used it as it's headquarters.

It's A Beautiful Day is an iconic store located at 3918 Broadway Blvd. It supplies the area with all things peaceful.
